# CVMFS Monitro Server
When I started my working I've access to legacy code from [cvmfs-emscripten](https://github.com/cvmfs-contrib/cvmfs-emscripten) which is a 
javascript library that provide cvmfs client operations in a web browser. In order to use it within the context of a node.js server side application.
I had to make a number of modifications.
